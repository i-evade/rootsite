<h2>whats comming?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>USA/Canada Server</li>
  <li>Discord server (with link gen bot) its gonna have like 4 members tho</li>
  <li>Better games site :)</li>
</ul>
<p>please keep in mind that I make almost no money with ads <br> and its expensive to keeps servers up and running (its quite expensive)</p>

<br><p>I never expected iEvade to get this popular, over 1,000,000 people a day use it meaning it will get slow, but I don't have the money for any more servers</p>
<br><p>but don't worry, I'm not gonna ask you to donate (yet) or give donators faster access or anything :D</p>
